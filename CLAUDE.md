# CLAUDE.md

## Purpose

Disposable exploration repo for building a competency scoring system for allUP. This is research-grade code -- expect experimentation, rough edges, and frequent pivots. The goal is to ingest external competency taxonomies, build a unified competency library, and score allUP user responses against it.

**Key distinction:** Tags remain allUP's identity layer (how users describe themselves). Competency scores are a new assessment layer (what their responses reveal about their abilities).

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Download and process datasets
cargo run -- download onet
cargo run -- download opm
cargo run -- download lightcast
cargo run -- download workbank

# Process raw data into normalized format
cargo run -- process onet
cargo run -- process opm
cargo run -- process lightcast
cargo run -- process workbank

# Build unified library from processed datasets
cargo run -- build-library

# Score user responses
cargo run -- score --user <user-id>
cargo run -- score --sample 100
```

## Querying allUP Data

Use the `allup-graphql` agent for any queries against the allUP backend. It handles schema lookup, auth, and query construction.

**Delegate, don't query directly.** The agent has reference docs for every service domain (users, prompts, jobs, analysis, search, etc.) at `.claude/skills/allup-graphql/reference/`.

The wrk-mcp server is configured to hit production (`-e production` in `.mcp.json`).

## Test Users

## Vault Research

This project connects to the Response Scoring Framework research in the Obsidian vault:

- **Project home:** `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_ROOT/01_Projects/Response Scoring Framework/`
- **Framework doc:** `Response Scoring & Competency Framework.md`
- **O*NET/OPM research:** `Research/ONET OPM Smart Street Competency Models Research.md`
- **Lightcast research:** `Research/Lightcast Labor Market Data Research.md`
- **Seniority matching:** `Research/Proposal for a Multidimensional Seniority Matching System.pdf`
- **Stanford SALT Lab:** `Research/Stanford SALT Lab - Future of Work with AI Agents.md`

## Environment

- **Rust edition:** 2021
- **Key deps:** serde, reqwest (rustls), tokio, csv, calamine (Excel), zip, clap, dotenvy
- **Auth:** `.env` file for API keys (Lightcast, etc.) -- gitignored
- **Raw datasets:** `datasets/raw/` is gitignored (large, re-downloadable)
- **Run outputs:** `runs/` is gitignored

## Development Notes

- This is exploration code. Optimize for speed of iteration, not production quality.
- Each dataset module should be self-contained: download raw files, parse them, output normalized JSON/YAML.
- The library schema will evolve as we understand what the datasets actually contain.
- Scoring is Phase 3 -- get the library built first.
